Hello I will update this file as time goes on for now all you need to know is that the sprties folder needs to be with the exe whether you build it from the source or just use the pre-built executable.
If you are going to build it yourself I used Mgwin and the command found in compile.txt you can try using other compilers but I found issues doing that I reccomend taking a look at [Raylib's wiki](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki)


 - In the next update I will:
    -  add a makefile
    -  fix issues with powerups spawning behind paddle
    -  add more powerups I have a few ideas in midn but lmk if you have any
    -  fix spelling mistakes
    -  add title screen
    -  unload everything at the end
    -  add audio
